# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel fairly confident with these.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I feel confident with these as well.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
These are a learning process. I feel somewhat comfortable, but more practice is needed.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent about 2 hours on this with the research included. It definitely took longer than expected. I will be sure to make note of that.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I still need to practice it more when it comes to the larger situations with the if/then statements. I will do that by atempting the other two code challenges, setting some time aside to that this weekend.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I don't have any specific ones now, but a lot of questions arise when I am going through the lessons/practice. I use google mostly, but will also post in slack.
